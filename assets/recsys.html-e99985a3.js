Therefore, it is natural to consider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local user/system holds a small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the whole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively train a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing their graph data. The first realistic scenario is subgraph link prediction task for recommendation systems, where the users can interact with items owned by different shops or sectors, which makes each data owner only holding a part of the global user-item graph. To simulate such scenarios, we use recommendation datasets from publicly available sources which have high-quality meta-data information.</p><h2 id="training" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#training" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Training</h2><p>Before starting training, make sure that setup with <code>config/fedml_config.yaml</code> is correct.
