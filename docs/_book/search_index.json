Here is a quick tour of FedML Open Source Library (https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML) and MLOps Platform (https://open.fedml.ai) with examples for different scenarios. \nFedML Feature Overview\n\nThe FedML logo reflects the mission of FedML Inc. We aim to build simple and versatile APIs for machine learning running anywhere and at any scale.\nIn other words, FedML supports both federated learning for data silos and distributed training for acceleration with MLOps and Open Source support, covering both cutting-edge academia research and industrial grade use cases. \n\nFedML Cheetah - Accelerate Model Training with User-friendly Distributed Training\nFedML Parrot - Simulating federated learning in the real world: (1) simulate FL using a single process (2) MPI-based FL Simulator (3) NCCL-based FL Simulator (fastest)\nFedML Octopus - Cross-silo Federated Learning for cross-organization/account training, including Python-based edge SDK.\nFedML Beehive - Cross-device Federated Learning for Smartphones and IoTs, including edge SDK for Android/iOS and embedded Linux.\n\nFedML MLOps: FedML's machine learning operation pipeline for AI running anywhere and at any scale.\n\nModel Serving: we focus on providing a better user experience for edge AI.\n\nQuick Start for Open Source Library\nhttps://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML\nInstallation\nTo get started, let's first install FedML.\npip install fedml\n\nFor more installation methods, please refer to installing FedML.\nA Quick Overview of the Code Architecture\nIn general, FedML source code architecture follows the paper which won the Best Paper Award at NeurIPS 2020 (FL workshop). Its original idea is presented at the live video and \nwhite paper by FedML co-founder Dr. Chaoyang He. \n\nAs of March 2022, FedML has been made into an AI company which aims to provide machine learning capability from anywhere and at any scale. The python version of FedML https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python is now reorganized as follows:\ncore: The FedML low-level API package. This package implements distributed computing by communication backend such as MPI, NCCL, MQTT, gRPC, PyTorch RPC, and also supports topology management. \nOther low-level APIs related to security and privacy are also supported. All algorithms and Scenarios are built based on the \"core\" package.\ndata: FedML will provide some default datasets for users to get started. Customization templates are also provided.\nmodel: FedML model zoo.\ndevice: FedML computing resource management.\nsimulation: FedML parrot can support (1) simulating FL using a single process (2) MPI-based FL Simulator (3) NCCL-based FL Simulator (fastest)\ncross_silo: Cross-silo Federated Learning for cross-organization/account training\ncross_device: Cross-device Federated Learning for Smartphones and IoTs\ndistributed: Distributed Training: Accelerate Model Training with Lightweight Cheetah\nserve: Model serving, tailored for edge inference\nmlops: APIs related to machine learning operation platform (open.fedml.ai)\ncentralized: Some centralized trainer code examples for benchmarking purposes.\nutils: Common utilities shared by other modules.\nSimplified APIs\n \n\nOur philosophy behind our API design is to reduce the number of APIs to as few as possible while simultaneously maintaining the flexibility. \nThe figure above shows the high-level overview of the API design. Essentially, each module has a package entry point (e.g., fedml.cross-silo) to manage related APIs, and FedML users can wrapper these APIs to meet their specific demands. \nSome high-level integrated APIs are also provided. For example, fedml.run_simulation() is just a one-line API for a quick start. \nNow let's get started with some simple examples. For Simplicity, FedML Parrot (simulator) supports one-line APIs as the following example:\n# main.py\n\nimport fedml\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    fedml.run_simulation()\n\npython main.py\nYou will get the following output:\n[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:28] [INFO] [__init__.py:30:init] args = {'yaml_config_file': '', 'run_id': '0', 'rank': 0, 'yaml_paths': ['/Users/chaoyanghe/opt/anaconda3/envs/mnn37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fedml-0.7.8-py3.7.egg/fedml/config/simulation_sp/fedml_config.yaml'], 'training_type': 'simulation', 'using_mlops': False, 'random_seed': 0, 'dataset': 'mnist', 'data_cache_dir': './data/mnist', 'partition_method': 'hetero', 'partition_alpha': 0.5, 'model': 'lr', 'federated_optimizer': 'FedAvg', 'client_id_list': '[]', 'client_num_in_total': 1000, 'client_num_per_round': 10, 'comm_round': 200, 'epochs': 1, 'batch_size': 10, 'client_optimizer': 'sgd', 'learning_rate': 0.03, 'weight_decay': 0.001, 'frequency_of_the_test': 5, 'using_gpu': False, 'gpu_id': 0, 'backend': 'single_process', 'log_file_dir': './log', 'enable_wandb': False}\n[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:28] [INFO] [device.py:14:get_device] device = cpu\n[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:28] [INFO] [data_loader.py:22:download_mnist] ./data/mnist/MNIST.zip\n[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:31] [INFO] [data_loader.py:57:load_synthetic_data] load_data. dataset_name = mnist\n...\nYou can also customize the hyper-parameters with fedml_config.yaml. Check out this tutorial for a one-line example for details.\nFor flexibility, one-line API can also be expanded into five lines of APIs. To illustrate this, let's switch to FedML Octopus (cross-silo federated learning) as example (Source code: https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python/examples/cross_silo/mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example).\nIn this example, the FL Client APIs are as follows:\nimport fedml\nfrom fedml import FedMLRunner\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    args = fedml.init()\n\n    # init device\n    device = fedml.device.get_device(args)\n\n    # load data\n    dataset, output_dim = fedml.data.load(args)\n\n    # load model\n    model = fedml.model.create(args, output_dim)\n\n    # start training\n    FedMLRunner(args, device, dataset, model).run()\n\nWith these APIs, you only need to tune the hyper-parameters with the configuration file fedml_config.yaml. An example is as follows:\ncommon_args:\n  training_type: \"cross_silo\"\n  scenario: \"horizontal\"\n  using_mlops: false\n  random_seed: 0\n\nenvironment_args:\n  bootstrap: config/bootstrap.sh\n\ndata_args:\n  dataset: \"mnist\"\n  data_cache_dir: ~/fedml_data\n  partition_method: \"hetero\"\n  partition_alpha: 0.5\n\nmodel_args:\n  model: \"lr\"\n  model_file_cache_folder: \"./model_file_cache\" # will be filled by the server automatically\n  global_model_file_path: \"./model_file_cache/global_model.pt\"\n\ntrain_args:\n  federated_optimizer: \"FedAvg\"\n  client_id_list:\n  client_num_in_total: 1\n  client_num_per_round: 2\n  comm_round: 10\n  epochs: 1\n  batch_size: 10\n  client_optimizer: sgd\n  learning_rate: 0.03\n  weight_decay: 0.001\n\nvalidation_args:\n  frequency_of_the_test: 1\n\ndevice_args:\n  worker_num: 2\n  using_gpu: false\n  gpu_mapping_file: config/gpu_mapping.yaml\n  gpu_mapping_key: mapping_default\n\ncomm_args:\n  backend: \"MQTT_S3\"\n  mqtt_config_path: config/mqtt_config.yaml\n  s3_config_path: config/s3_config.yaml\n  # If you want to use your customized MQTT or s3 server as training backends, you should uncomment and set the following lines.\n  #customized_training_mqtt_config: {'BROKER_HOST': 'your mqtt server address or domain name', 'MQTT_PWD': 'your mqtt password', 'BROKER_PORT': 1883, 'MQTT_KEEPALIVE': 180, 'MQTT_USER': 'your mqtt user'}\n  #customized_training_s3_config: {'CN_S3_SAK': 'your s3 aws_secret_access_key', 'CN_REGION_NAME': 'your s3 region name', 'CN_S3_AKI': 'your s3 aws_access_key_id', 'BUCKET_NAME': 'your s3 bucket name'}\n\ntracking_args:\n   # When running on MLOps platform(open.fedml.ai), the default log path is at ~/fedml-client/fedml/logs/ and ~/fedml-server/fedml/logs/\n  enable_wandb: false\n\nNow let's run some examples to get a sense of how FedML simplifies federated learning in diverse real-world settings.\nFedML Parrot Examples\nSimulation with a Single Process (Standalone):\n\nsp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example: \nSimulating FL using a single process in your personal laptop or server. This is helpful for researchers hoping to try a quick algorithmic idea in small synthetic datasets (MNIST, shakespeare, etc.) and small models (ResNet-18, Logistic Regression, etc.). \n\nSimulation with Message Passing Interface (MPI):\n\nmpi_torch_fedavg_mnist_lr_example: \nMPI-based Federated Learning for cross-GPU/CPU servers.\n\nSimulation with NCCL-based MPI (the fastest training):\n\nIf your cross-GPU bandwidth is high (e.g., InfiniBand, NVLink, EFA, etc.), we suggest using this NCCL-based MPI FL simulator to accelerate your development. \n\nFedML Octopus Examples\nHorizontal Federated Learning:\n\nmqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example: an example to illustrate running horizontal federated learning in data silos (hospitals, banks, etc.)\n\nHierarchical Federated Learning:\n\nhierarchical_fedavg_mnist_lr_example: an example to illustrate running hierarchical federated learning in data silos (hospitals, banks, etc.). \nHere hierarchical implies that each FL Client (data silo) has multiple GPUs that can run local distributed training with PyTorch DDP, and the FL server then aggregates globally from the results received from all FL Clients.\n\nFedML Beehive Examples\n\nFederated Learning on Android Smartphones\n\nMLOps User Guide\nhttps://open.fedml.ai\nCurrently, the project developed based on FedML Octopus (cross-silo) and Beehive (cross-device) can be smoothly deployed into the real-world system using FedML MLOps.\nThe FedML MLOps Platform simplifies the workflow of federated learning from anywhere and at any scale.\nIt enables zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure federated learning.\nIt enables machine learning from decentralized data at various users/silos/edge nodes, without the need to centralize any data to the cloud, hence providing maximum privacy and efficiency.\n\nThe above figure shows the workflow, which is handled by a web UI that avoids using complex deployment.

Federated learning (FL) provides promising approaches for a large number of clients (e.g., personal devices or organizations) to collaboratively learn a shared\nglobal model to benefit all clients while allowing users to keep their data locally. Despite interest in studying FL methods for NLP\ntasks, a systematic comparison and analysis is lacking in the literature. Herein, we\npresent the FedNLP, a benchmarking framework for evaluating federated learning methods on four different task formulations: text\nclassification, sequence tagging, question answering, and seq2seq. We propose a universal interface between Transformer-based language models (e.g., BERT, BART) and FL\nmethods (e.g., FedAvg, FedOPT, etc.) under\nvarious non-IID partitioning strategies. Our\nextensive experiments with FedNLP provide\nempirical comparisons between FL methods\nand helps us better understand the inherent\nchallenges of this direction. The comprehensive analysis points to intriguing and exciting\nfuture research aimed at developing FL methods for NLP tasks.\n\nFedGraphNN: A Federated Learning Benchmark System for Graph Neural Networks\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11066.pdf\nPublished at ICLR'21-DPML and MLSys'21-GNNSys workshops\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data.\nHowever, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial\ncompetitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed learning paradigm,\nprovides possibilities to solve this challenge while preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable platform\nfor the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is\nbuilt on a unified formulation of graph FL and contains a wide range of datasets\nfrom different domains, popular GNN models, and FL algorithms, with secure\nand efficient system support. Particularly for the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains, including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as hERG and Tencent. Our\nempirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs perform worse in most\ndatasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not maintain its advantage\nin the FL setting. These results imply that more research efforts are needed\nto unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs. Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN system is computationally\nefficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets. \n\nFedCV: A Federated Learning Framework for Diverse Computer Vision Tasks\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07145.pdf\nPublished at FL-AAAI’2022\nFederated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning\nparadigm that can learn a global or personalized model\nfrom decentralized datasets on edge devices. However, in\nthe computer vision domain, model performance in FL is far\nbehind centralized training due to the lack of exploration in\ndiverse tasks with a unified FL framework. FL has rarely\nbeen demonstrated effectively in advanced computer vision\ntasks such as object detection and image segmentation. To\nbridge the gap and facilitate the development of FL for\ncomputer vision tasks, in this work, we propose a federated learning library and benchmarking framework, named\nFedCV, to evaluate FL on the three most representative computer vision tasks: image classification, image segmentation,\nand object detection. We provide non-I.I.D. benchmarking\ndatasets, models, and various reference FL algorithms. Our\nbenchmark study suggests that there are multiple challenges\nthat deserve future exploration: centralized training tricks\nmay not be directly applied to FL; the non-I.I.D. dataset\nactually downgrades the model accuracy to some degree in\ndifferent tasks; improving the system efficiency of federated\ntraining is challenging given the huge number of parameters and the per-client memory cost. We believe that such\na library and benchmark, along with comparable evaluation settings, is necessary to make meaningful progress in\nFL on computer vision tasks\n\nFedIoT: Federated Learning for Internet of Things\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07976.pdf\nPublished at ACM Sensys’21\nFederated learning can be a promising solution for enabling IoT cybersecurity (i.e., anomaly detection\nin the IoT environment) while preserving data privacy and mitigating the high communication/storage overhead (e.g., high-frequency data from time-series sensors) of centralized over-the-cloud\napproaches. In this paper, to further push forward this direction with a comprehensive study in\nboth algorithm and system design, we build FedIoT platform that contains FedDetect algorithm\nfor on-device anomaly data detection and a system design for realistic evaluation of federated\nlearning on IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed FedDetect learning framework improves the\nperformance by utilizing a local adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a cross-round learning rate\nscheduler. In a network of realistic IoT devices (Raspberry PI), we evaluate FedIoT platform and\nFedDetect algorithm in both model and system performance. Our results demonstrate the efficacy\nof federated learning in detecting a wider range of attack types occurred at multiple devices. The\nsystem efficiency analysis indicates that both end-to-end training time and memory cost are affordable and promising for resource-constrained IoT devices.\n\n"},"starter/examples.html":{"url":"starter/examples.html","title":"Learning FedML with Examples","keywords":"","body":"Learning FedML with Examples\nThis tutorial will show you how to use FedML and Pytorch to perform Federated Learning with the following examples:\nFederated Averaging (FedAvg) Learning with MNIST dataset\n\nSimulation\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: simulation\n\n    simulation-examples/single process.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-simple.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-base-framework.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-robust.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-decentrilized.md\n\n\n\nCross-silo\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/mqtt-s3.md\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/grpc.md\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/trpc.md\n\nCross-device\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-device\n\n    cross-device-examples/mqtt-s3.md\n\n\n\nFederated Optimization (FedOpt) Learning with EMNIST dataset\n~~~~\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: simulation\nsimulation-examples/single process.md\n"},"starter/faq.html":{"url":"starter/faq.html","title":"FedML FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FedML FAQ\n \nWe organize the frequently asked questions at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/discussions. \nPlease feel free to ask questions there.

It deviated from the Nvidia official image which is large size.\nSo the FedML standard docker image will be a large image. Now it is about 17GB in size. Up to now, the FedML standard docker image can run on the Linux platform.\nIf you want to run on the MacOS platform, you should use the FedML light docker image which can be running on multiple architectures, e.g. X86, ARM, etc.\n(1) Pull the standard Docker image and prepare the docker environment\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\ndocker pull $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE\n\n# if you want to use GPUs in your host OS, please follow this link: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2\nsudo systemctl restart docker\nsudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock\n\n(2) Run standard Docker with interactive mode\nOn GPUs:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\ndocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --gpus all --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -ti $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash\n\nOn CPUs:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\nddocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -ti $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash\n\nYou should now see a prompt that looks something like,\nyou may run the 'fedml login $YourUserId' to log into the MLOps platform.\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# fedml login 1606\n\nAnd also, you may enter into the $WORKSPACE which is your host directory to run your own examples:\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# cd $WORKSPACE\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/home/fedml/fedml_source#\n\nFedML Light Docker Image\n(1) Run light Docker with interactive mode\nThe light docker is a smaller image about 2.3GB size. So it can pull and run more smoothly.\nThe light docker just supports cpu arch. So, if you want to use the GPU, you should use the above standard Docker with gpu options.\nEach docker image needs more than 5GB memory size to run the fedml learning task.\n(This is estimated with the MNist dataset, if you use other dataset, Maybe the memory size is larger or smaller than the size with the MNist dataset)\nSo, you need to reserve sufficient memory size for your federated learning task.\nOn MacOS, you should set memory size in the navigation path DockerDesktop -> Preference -> Resource -> Memory.\nIf you want to run three docker containers simultaneously, you need to set the resource memory to not less than 15GB.\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:light\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\ndocker run -v

Kubernetes pods running on GPU/CPU physical nodes.\nThe entire workflow is as follows:\n(k8s deployment file is located in: https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/installation/install_on_k8s/fedml-edge-client-server)\n\nIn the file fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-client.yml, modify the variable ACCOUNT_ID to your desired value\nDeploy the fedml client:  kubectl apply -f ./fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-client.yml\nIn the file fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-server.yml, modify the variable ACCOUNT_ID to your desired value\nDeploy the fedml server:  kubectl apply -f ./fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-server.yml\nLogin the FedML MLOps platform https://open.fedml.ai, the above deployed client and server will be found in the edge devices\n\nIf you want to scale up or scal down the pods to your desired count, you may run the following command:\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-client-deployment\n\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-server-deployment\n\nInstallation with Helm Charts\nAlso, you may use the helm charts to deploy your fedml client and server to target Kubernetes cluster.\nYou just need to run the following commands with your user id at the open.fedml.ai.\nkubectl create namespace fedml\nhelm install --set image.repository=\"fedml/fedml-edge-client-server-light\" --set env.fedmlAccountId=\"$YourUserId\" --set env.role=\"client\" fedml-client-deployment ./fedml-client-deployment-latest.tgz\nhelm install --set image.repository=\"fedml/fedml-edge-client-server-light\" --set env.fedmlAccountId=\"$YourUserId\" --set env.role=\"server\" fedml-server-deployment ./fedml-server-deployment-latest.tgz\n\nQ&A\n\nQ: How to scale up or scale down?A: Use the following commands:\n\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-client-deployment\n\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-server-deployment\n\n\nQ: FedML Client send online status to FedML Server via which protocol?A: Via MQTT\n\n\nQ: FedML Client send model, gradient parameters to FedML Server via which protocol?A: Use S3 protocol to store and exchange models and use MQTT to exchange messages between FedML Client and Server\n\n\nQ: Why do we need AWS S3?A: Use S3 protocol to store and exchange models.\n\nGuidance for Windows Users\nPlease follow instructions

Despite interest in studying FL methods for NLP\ntasks, a systematic comparison and analysis is lacking in the literature. Herein, we\npresent the FedNLP, a benchmarking framework for evaluating federated learning methods on four different task formulations: text\nclassification, sequence tagging, question answering, and seq2seq. We propose a universal interface between Transformer-based language models (e.g., BERT, BART) and FL\nmethods (e.g., FedAvg, FedOPT, etc.) under\nvarious non-IID partitioning strategies. Our\nextensive experiments with FedNLP provide\nempirical comparisons between FL methods\nand helps us better understand the inherent\nchallenges of this direction. The comprehensive analysis points to intriguing and exciting\nfuture research aimed at developing FL methods for NLP tasks.\n\nFedGraphNN: A Federated Learning Benchmark System for Graph Neural Networks\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11066.pdf\nPublished at ICLR'21-DPML and MLSys'21-GNNSys workshops\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data.\nHowever, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial\ncompetitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed learning paradigm,\nprovides possibilities to solve this challenge while preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable platform\nfor the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is\nbuilt on a unified formulation of graph FL and contains a wide range of datasets\nfrom different domains, popular GNN models, and FL algorithms, with secure\nand efficient system support. Particularly for the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains, including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as hERG and Tencent. Our\nempirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs perform worse in most\ndatasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not maintain its advantage\nin the FL setting. These results imply that more research efforts are needed\nto unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs. Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN system is computationally\nefficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets. \n\nFedCV: A Federated Learning Framework for Diverse Computer Vision Tasks\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07145.pdf\nPublished at FL-AAAI’2022\nFederated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning\nparadigm that can learn a global or personalized model\nfrom decentralized datasets on edge devices. However, in\nthe computer vision domain, model performance in FL is far\nbehind centralized training due to the lack of exploration in\ndiverse tasks with a unified FL framework. FL has rarely\nbeen demonstrated effectively in advanced computer vision\ntasks such as object detection and image segmentation. To\nbridge the gap and facilitate the development of FL for\ncomputer vision tasks, in this work, we propose a federated learning library and benchmarking framework, named\nFedCV, to evaluate FL on the three most representative computer vision tasks: image classification, image segmentation,\nand object detection. We provide non-I.I.D. benchmarking\ndatasets, models, and various reference FL algorithms. Our\nbenchmark study suggests that there are multiple challenges\nthat deserve future exploration: centralized training tricks\nmay not be directly applied to FL; the non-I.I.D. dataset\nactually downgrades the model accuracy to some degree in\ndifferent tasks; improving the system efficiency of federated\ntraining is challenging given the huge number of parameters and the per-client memory cost. We believe that such\na library and benchmark, along with comparable evaluation settings, is necessary to make meaningful progress in\nFL on computer vision tasks\n\nFedIoT: Federated Learning for Internet of Things\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07976.pdf\nPublished at ACM Sensys’21\nFederated learning can be a promising solution for enabling IoT cybersecurity (i.e., anomaly detection\nin the IoT environment) while preserving data privacy and mitigating the high communication/storage overhead (e.g., high-frequency data from time-series sensors) of centralized over-the-cloud\napproaches. In this paper, to further push forward this direction with a comprehensive study in\nboth algorithm and system design, we build FedIoT platform that contains FedDetect algorithm\nfor on-device anomaly data detection and a system design for realistic evaluation of federated\nlearning on IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed FedDetect learning framework improves the\nperformance by utilizing a local adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a cross-round learning rate\nscheduler. In a network of realistic IoT devices (Raspberry PI), we evaluate FedIoT platform and\nFedDetect algorithm in both model and system performance. Our results demonstrate the efficacy\nof federated learning in detecting a wider range of attack types occurred at multiple devices. The\nsystem efficiency analysis indicates that both end-to-end training time and memory cost are affordable and promising for resource-constrained IoT devices.\n\n"},"cn/starter/examples.html":{"url":"cn/starter/examples.html","title":"Learning FedML with Examples","keywords":"","body":"Learning FedML with Examples\nThis tutorial will show you how to use FedML and Pytorch to perform Federated Learning with the following examples:\nFederated Averaging (FedAvg) Learning with MNIST dataset\n\nSimulation\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: simulation\n\n    simulation-examples/single process.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-simple.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-base-framework.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-robust.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-decentrilized.md\n\n\n\nCross-silo\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/mqtt-s3.md\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/grpc.md\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/trpc.md\n\nCross-device\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-device\n\n    cross-device-examples/mqtt-s3.md\n\n\n\nFederated Optimization (FedOpt) Learning with EMNIST dataset\n~~~~\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: simulation\nsimulation-examples/single process.md\n"},"cn/starter/faq.html":{"url":"cn/starter/faq.html","title":"FedML FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FedML FAQ\n \nWe organize the frequently asked questions at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/discussions. \nPlease feel free to ask questions there.

Currently, we maintain docker images for x86_64 architecture.\nBut for your own purpose, you may build your docker image to support the following architectures: arm, raspberrypi, nvidia jetson via our Dockerfile located in the directory\nhttps://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/installation/build_fedml_docker\nPlease refer to the following commands and remember to change LOCAL_WORKSPACE to your own.\nFedML Standard Docker Image\nThe FedML standard docker image can support to run on CPU an GPU devices. It deviated from the Nvidia official image which is large size.\nSo the FedML standard docker image will be a large image. Now it is about 17GB in size. Up to now, the FedML standard docker image can run on the Linux platform.\nIf you want to run on the MacOS platform, you should use the FedML light docker image which can be running on multiple architectures, e.g. X86, ARM, etc.\n(1) Pull the standard Docker image and prepare the docker environment\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\ndocker pull $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE\n\n# if you want to use GPUs in your host OS, please follow this link: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2\nsudo systemctl restart docker\nsudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock\n\n(2) Run standard Docker with interactive mode\nOn GPUs:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\ndocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --gpus all --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -ti $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash\n\nOn CPUs:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\nddocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -ti $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash\n\nYou should now see a prompt that looks something like,\nyou may run the 'fedml login $YourUserId' to log into the MLOps platform.\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# fedml login 1606\n\nAnd also, you may enter into the $WORKSPACE which is your host directory to run your own examples:\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# cd $WORKSPACE\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/home/fedml/fedml_source#\n\nFedML Light Docker Image\n(1) Run light Docker with interactive mode\nThe light docker is a smaller image about 2.3GB size.

Due to privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions, it is hard to collect users and/or organizations data into a single silo. This is especially crucial for bioinformatics and drug discovery applications. Coupled with the aforementioned reasons, learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity, heterogeneity, and highly imbalanced classification. As an example, biomedical institutions might hold their own set of molecules which cannot be directly shared across silos due to commercial and privacy reasons. To simulate such scenarios, we utilize datasets from MoleculeNet.\nFor this task we have two separate sub-tasks which have exactly the same coding style, only differing in task and the datasets:\n\nGraph Classification\nGraph Property Regression\n\nDataset Preparation\nBefore training, each dataset has to be downloaded first from our servers. For instance, to process sider dataset, all you have to do is to run the bash script under  /moleculenet_graph_clf/data/sider folder: \ncd data/sider\nsh download_and_unzip.sh\n\nDataset preparation is same for all datasets.\nTraining\nBefore starting training, make sure that setup with  config/fedml_config.yaml is correct. Then start the training with the desired number of GPU workers.\nWORKSPACE=./FedML/app/fedgraphnn/applications/moleculenet_graph_clf\ncd $WORKSPACE\n\nsh run_moleculenet_clf.sh 4\n\n"},"es/benchmark/fedgraphnn/recsys.html":{"url":"es/benchmark/fedgraphnn/recsys.html","title":"Subgraph-Level Link Prediction for Recommender Systems","keywords":"","body":"Subgraph-Level Link Prediction for Recommender Systems\nMotivation\nAs graphs are getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs\nseparately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is natural to\nconsider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local user/system holds\na small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the whole graph.\nHence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively train a powerful\nand generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing their graph data. The first realistic scenario is subgraph link prediction task for recommendation\nsystems, where the users can interact with items owned by different shops or sectors, which\nmakes each data owner only holding a part of the global user-item graph. To simulate such\nscenarios, we use recommendation datasets from publicly available sources  which have high-quality meta-data information.\nTraining\nBefore starting training, make sure that setup with  config/fedml_config.yaml is correct. For this tasks we have two available datasets:  ciao and epinions.

With the foundational support from FedML Core Framework, it supports FedNLP (Natural Language Processing), FedCV (Computer Vision), FedGraphNN (Graph Neural Networks), and FedIoT (Internet of Things).\nFedNLP: Benchmarking Federated Learning Methods for Natural Language Processing Tasks\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08815.pdf\nPublished at NAACL 2022.\nIncreasing concerns and regulations about data\nprivacy and sparsity necessitate the study\nof privacy-preserving, decentralized learning methods for natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. Federated learning (FL) provides promising approaches for a large number of clients (e.g., personal devices or organizations) to collaboratively learn a shared\nglobal model to benefit all clients while allowing users to keep their data locally. Despite interest in studying FL methods for NLP\ntasks, a systematic comparison and analysis is lacking in the literature. Herein, we\npresent the FedNLP, a benchmarking framework for evaluating federated learning methods on four different task formulations: text\nclassification, sequence tagging, question answering, and seq2seq. We propose a universal interface between Transformer-based language models (e.g., BERT, BART) and FL\nmethods (e.g., FedAvg, FedOPT, etc.) under\nvarious non-IID partitioning strategies. Our\nextensive experiments with FedNLP provide\nempirical comparisons between FL methods\nand helps us better understand the inherent\nchallenges of this direction. The comprehensive analysis points to intriguing and exciting\nfuture research aimed at developing FL methods for NLP tasks.\n\nFedGraphNN: A Federated Learning Benchmark System for Graph Neural Networks\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11066.pdf\nPublished at ICLR'21-DPML and MLSys'21-GNNSys workshops\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data.\nHowever, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial\ncompetitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed learning paradigm,\nprovides possibilities to solve this challenge while preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable platform\nfor the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is\nbuilt on a unified formulation of graph FL and contains a wide range of datasets\nfrom different domains, popular GNN models, and FL algorithms, with secure\nand efficient system support. Particularly for the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains, including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as hERG and Tencent. Our\nempirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs perform worse in most\ndatasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not maintain its advantage\nin the FL setting. These results imply that more research efforts are needed\nto unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs. Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN system is computationally\nefficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets. \n\nFedCV: A Federated Learning Framework for Diverse Computer Vision Tasks\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07145.pdf\nPublished at FL-AAAI’2022\nFederated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning\nparadigm that can learn a global or personalized model\nfrom decentralized datasets on edge devices. However, in\nthe computer vision domain, model performance in FL is far\nbehind centralized training due to the lack of exploration in\ndiverse tasks with a unified FL framework. FL has rarely\nbeen demonstrated effectively in advanced computer vision\ntasks such as object detection and image segmentation. To\nbridge the gap and facilitate the development of FL for\ncomputer vision tasks, in this work, we propose a federated learning library and benchmarking framework, named\nFedCV, to evaluate FL on the three most representative computer vision tasks: image classification, image segmentation,\nand object detection. We provide non-I.I.D. benchmarking\ndatasets, models, and various reference FL algorithms. Our\nbenchmark study suggests that there are multiple challenges\nthat deserve future exploration: centralized training tricks\nmay not be directly applied to FL; the non-I.I.D. dataset\nactually downgrades the model accuracy to some degree in\ndifferent tasks; improving the system efficiency of federated\ntraining is challenging given the huge number of parameters and the per-client memory cost. We believe that such\na library and benchmark, along with comparable evaluation settings, is necessary to make meaningful progress in\nFL on computer vision tasks\n\nFedIoT: Federated Learning for Internet of Things\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07976.pdf\nPublished at ACM Sensys’21\nFederated learning can be a promising solution for enabling IoT cybersecurity (i.e., anomaly detection\nin the IoT environment) while preserving data privacy and mitigating the high communication/storage overhead (e.g., high-frequency data from time-series sensors) of centralized over-the-cloud\napproaches. In this paper, to further push forward this direction with a comprehensive study in\nboth algorithm and system design, we build FedIoT platform that contains FedDetect algorithm\nfor on-device anomaly data detection and a system design for realistic evaluation of federated\nlearning on IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed FedDetect learning framework improves the\nperformance by utilizing a local adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a cross-round learning rate\nscheduler. In a network of realistic IoT devices (Raspberry PI), we evaluate FedIoT platform and\nFedDetect algorithm in both model and system performance. Our results demonstrate the efficacy\nof federated learning in detecting a wider range of attack types occurred at multiple devices. The\nsystem efficiency analysis indicates that both end-to-end training time and memory cost are affordable and promising for resource-constrained IoT devices.\n\n"},"es/starter/examples.html":{"url":"es/starter/examples.html","title":"Learning FedML with Examples","keywords":"","body":"Learning FedML with Examples\nThis tutorial will show you how to use FedML and Pytorch to perform Federated Learning with the following examples:\nFederated Averaging (FedAvg) Learning with MNIST dataset\n\nSimulation\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: simulation\n\n    simulation-examples/single process.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-simple.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-base-framework.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-robust.md\n    simulation-examples/mpi-decentrilized.md\n\n\n\nCross-silo\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/mqtt-s3.md\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/grpc.md\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-silo\n\n    cross-silo-examples/trpc.md\n\nCross-device\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    :name: cross-device\n\n    cross-device-examples/mqtt-s3.md\n\n\n\nFederated Optimization (FedOpt) Learning with EMNIST dataset\n~~~~\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :name: simulation\nsimulation-examples/single process.md\n"},"es/starter/faq.html":{"url":"es/starter/faq.html","title":"FedML FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FedML FAQ\n \nWe organize the frequently asked questions at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/discussions. \nPlease feel free to ask questions there.

Up to now, the FedML standard docker image can run on the Linux platform.\nIf you want to run on the MacOS platform, you should use the FedML light docker image which can be running on multiple architectures, e.g. X86, ARM, etc.\n(1) Pull the standard Docker image and prepare the docker environment\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\ndocker pull $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE\n\n# if you want to use GPUs in your host OS, please follow this link: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2\nsudo systemctl restart docker\nsudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock\n\n(2) Run standard Docker with interactive mode\nOn GPUs:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\ndocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --gpus all --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -ti $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash\n\nOn CPUs:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:latest-torch1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\nddocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -ti $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash\n\nYou should now see a prompt that looks something like,\nyou may run the 'fedml login $YourUserId' to log into the MLOps platform.\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# fedml login 1606\n\nAnd also, you may enter into the $WORKSPACE which is your host directory to run your own examples:\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# cd $WORKSPACE\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/home/fedml/fedml_source#\n\nFedML Light Docker Image\n(1) Run light Docker with interactive mode\nThe light docker is a smaller image about 2.3GB size. So it can pull and run more smoothly.\nThe light docker just supports cpu arch. So, if you want to use the GPU, you should use the above standard Docker with gpu options.\nEach docker image needs more than 5GB memory size to run the fedml learning task.\n(This is estimated with the MNist dataset, if you use other dataset, Maybe the memory size is larger or smaller than the size with the MNist dataset)\nSo, you need to reserve sufficient memory size for your federated learning task.\nOn MacOS, you should set memory size in the navigation path DockerDesktop -> Preference -> Resource -> Memory.\nIf you want to run three docker containers simultaneously, you need to set the resource memory to not less than 15GB.\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:light\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\n\ndocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -ti $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash\n\nYou should now see a prompt that looks something like,\nyou may run the 'fedml login $YourUserId' to log into the MLOps platform.\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# fedml login 1606\n\nAnd also, you may enter into the $WORKSPACE which is your host directory to run your own examples:\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/#\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/# cd $WORKSPACE\nroot@142ffce4cdf8:/home/fedml/fedml_source#\n\n(2) Run light Docker with daemon mode and automatically log into the MLOps platform\nYou may run the light docker as the daemon mode and automatically log into the MLOps platform as the client.\nThe commands ars as follows:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:light\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\nYOUR_FEDML_USER_ID=1606\n\ndocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -d $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE bash -c 'fedml login '$YOUR_FEDML_USER_ID';sleep 100000'\n\nYou may run the light docker as the daemon mode and automatically log into the MLOps platform as the server with the option -s.\nThe commands ars as follows:\nFEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE=fedml/fedml:light\nLOCAL_WORKSPACE=$PleaseUseYourLocalDirectory\nDOCKER_WORKSPACE=/home/fedml/fedml_source\nYOUR_FEDML_USER_ID=1606\n\ndocker run -v $LOCAL_WORKSPACE:$DOCKER_WORKSPACE --shm-size=64g --ulimit nofile=65535 --ulimit memlock=-1 --privileged --network=host --env WORKSPACE=$DOCKER_WORKSPACE -d $FEDML_DOCKER_IMAGE bash -c 'fedml login -s '$YOUR_FEDML_USER_ID';sleep 100000'\n\nAfter you run the above command, the terminal will show the container id like the following format.\nb0769135f8e65c5b0b7b7cb9666f3f910a4e431c25084ed72ae059ea1a6376af\nIf you want to show logs for the fedml light container, you may run the following command with the above container id.\ndocker logs b0769135f8e65c5b0b7b7cb9666f3f910a4e431c25084ed72ae059ea1a6376af\n\nIf you want to list the fedml light containers, you may run the command.\ndocker ps |grep fedml:light\n\nIf you want to kill all fedml light containers, the command is as follows.\ndocker stop `docker ps |grep fedml:light |awk -F' ' '{print $1}'`\n\n(4) Run the interpreter in PyCharm or Visual Studio using Docker environment\n\nPyCharm\n\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html#summary\n\nVisual Studio\n\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers\n(4) Other useful commands\n# docker rm $(docker ps -aq)\ndocker container kill $(docker ps -q)\n\nRunning FedML on Kubernetes\nThis tutorial will guide you to deploy your fedml client and server to target Kubernetes pods running on GPU/CPU physical nodes.\nThe entire workflow is as follows:\n(k8s deployment file is located in: https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/installation/install_on_k8s/fedml-edge-client-server)\n\nIn the file fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-client.yml, modify the variable ACCOUNT_ID to your desired value\nDeploy the fedml client:  kubectl apply -f ./fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-client.yml\nIn the file fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-server.yml, modify the variable ACCOUNT_ID to your desired value\nDeploy the fedml server:  kubectl apply -f ./fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-server.yml\nLogin the FedML MLOps platform https://open.fedml.ai, the above deployed client and server will be found in the edge devices\n\nIf you want to scale up or scal down the pods to your desired count, you may run the following command:\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-client-deployment\n\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-server-deployment\n\nInstallation with Helm Charts\nAlso, you may use the helm charts to deploy your fedml client and server to target Kubernetes cluster.\nYou just need to run the following commands with your user id at the open.fedml.ai.\nkubectl create namespace fedml\nhelm install --set image.repository=\"fedml/fedml-edge-client-server-light\" --set env.fedmlAccountId=\"$YourUserId\" --set env.role=\"client\" fedml-client-deployment ./fedml-client-deployment-latest.tgz\nhelm install --set image.repository=\"fedml/fedml-edge-client-server-light\" --set env.fedmlAccountId=\"$YourUserId\" --set env.role=\"server\" fedml-server-deployment ./fedml-server-deployment-latest.tgz\n\nQ&A\n\nQ: How to scale up or scale down?A: Use the following commands:\n\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-client-deployment\n\nkubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-server-deployment\n\n\nQ: FedML Client send online status to FedML Server via which protocol?A: Via MQTT\n\n\nQ: FedML Client send model, gradient parameters to FedML Server via which protocol?A: Use S3 protocol to store and exchange models and use MQTT to exchange messages between FedML Client and Server\n\n\nQ: Why do we need AWS S3?A: Use S3 protocol to store and exchange models.\n\nGuidance for Windows Users\nPlease follow instructions
