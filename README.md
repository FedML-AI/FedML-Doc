## Why FedML?

FedML, Inc. (https://fedml.ai) enables people and/or organizations to have AI capability from data anywhere at any scale. FedML stands for **“Fundamental Ecosystem Development/Design for Machine Learning”** in a broad scope, and “Federated Machine Learning” in a specific scope. At its current stage, FedML is developing and maintaining a machine learning platform that enables **zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure federated learning and analytics**. It enables machine learning from decentralized data at various **users/silos/edge** nodes without requiring data centralization to the cloud, thus providing maximum privacy and efficiency. It consists of a lightweight and cross-platform Edge AI SDK that is deployable over edge GPUs, smartphones, and IoT devices. Furthermore, it also provides a user-friendly MLOps platform to simplify decentralized machine learning and real-world deployment. FedML supports vertical solutions across a broad range of industries (healthcare, finance, insurance, smart cities, IoT, etc.) and applications (computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, and time-series forecasting). Its core technology is backed by over 3 years of cutting-edge research by its co-founders.
